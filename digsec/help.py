    digsec <command> <flags>

    command can be:
    - query: perform a DNSSEC query
    - download: download and save official trust anchors (from IANA)
    - validate: validate DNSSEC records saved by query

    Potential use cases:
    - Save DNS query/response packets
    - Display DNS protocol messages and their friendly interpretation
    - Run and observe DNSSEC validation process

    Recommendation for first use:
    - run download to save DS trust anchors
    - run query for any domain you want (e.g. www.metebalci.com)
    - run validate when you want, but you need to run query first for
      parent domains for a proper authentication chain
      (e.g. metebalci.com. , com. , .)

    Help:
    Use +help flag with a command to learn more.

    Debugging:
    +debug flag can be used with all commands, but it is not intended for
     general use.

    digsec query [@server] <qname> [<qtype>] [<qclass>] <flags>

    Use dot "." as qname to query for root domain.

    FLAGS are:
          +[no]rd: set/reset Recursive Desired flag
          +[no]cd: set/reset Checking Disabled flag
          +[no]do: set/reset DNSSEC OK bit in EDNS
          +udp_payload_size=<size>: set UDP payload size (in octets) in EDNS
          +timeout=<timeout>: set socket timeout in seconds (float), default is 1 seconds
          +[no]show-friendly: show query and response in friendly format
          +[no]show-protocol: show query and response in protocol format
          +save-answer: save the answer
          +save-answer-prefix=<prefix>: save file with prefix
          +save-answer-dir=<path>: save file to path
          +save-packets=filename: save query and response to filename.q and .r
          +help: show this help
          +debug: enable debug mode

    Default FLAGS are:
          if +save-answer is not specified, +show-friendly is implied.
          if server is not specified, Google Public DNS 8.8.8.8 is used at port 53.

    Notes:
    - +do requires +udp_payload_size=<size>
    - Filename for +save-answer is:
        - For non-RRSIG answers: [prefix]qname.qclass.qtype
        - For RRSIG answers: [prefix]qname.qclass.qtype.RRSIG_type_covered
          because there is a different RRSIG for each type
        - If prefix is not specified, it is empty string
        - If dir is not specified, it is current working directory
    - For filenames, "_root" is used if qname is dot "."

    Why udp_payload_size is a must ?
    - UDP payload size cannot be removed, because it has to be in EDNS
      and EDNS is a must for DNSSEC.
